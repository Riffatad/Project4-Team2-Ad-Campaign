# 📊 Ad Campaign Performance Analysis

A data analysis project focused on evaluating and optimizing digital ad campaign performance using Python, Pandas, and data visualization tools. Developed as part of a team project during the Rutgers Data Science Bootcamp.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to analyze customer responses to various advertising strategies to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions on ad spend optimization, campaign strategy, and customer targeting.

By examining ad engagement data, we identify patterns in user behavior, evaluate key performance indicators (KPIs), and provide actionable insights to improve campaign effectiveness.

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess raw ad campaign data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Segment audience by engagement metrics
- Visualize campaign performance trends
- Provide strategic recommendations based on data insights

---

## 🗃️ Dataset

- **Source:** Provided via Rutgers Bootcamp
- **Format:** CSV
- **Features Include:**
  - `Ad Topic Line`
  - `City`, `Country`
  - `Timestamp`
  - `Clicked on Ad`
  - `Age`, `Area Income`, `Daily Time Spent on Site`, `Daily Internet Usage`

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** – Numerical computing
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Exploratory analysis and documentation
- **scikit-learn** – (Optional extension) for potential future modeling

---

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Checked for missing values and cleaned data
- Created histograms, scatter plots, and pair plots to assess variable distributions
- Analyzed correlations between demographics and click behavior
- Grouped data by time and region to detect performance trends

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Users who spend more time on the site are less likely to click ads
- Higher income groups tend to click fewer ads
- Internet usage and daily site time strongly correlate with ad engagement
- Certain cities have significantly higher click-through rates
